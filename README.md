Create a seconds-counter component.

- The whole purpose of the component is to display how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad).
- Use the ReactDOM.render() to render the component into the web-app.
- Use the setInterval() function to re-render de component on every second.
- The component does not need a local state, you can pass the number of seconds as props like this: <SecondsCounter seconds={3434} />
- You can find the clock icon on the left of the component in Font Awesome.
